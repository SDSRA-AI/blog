The AI Lab at Samsung SDS Research America is based in San Jose, California and is focused on researching and implementing technologies that support the development of intelligent agents that can perceive the state of an environment and take a sequence of actions that optimize an objective function over time.

This are of focus has led into the study and application of deep learning and reinforcement learning methods.

In this blog site, the AI Lab team members share their thoughts about these technologies, discuss their line of work and present some of the conducted experiments.
